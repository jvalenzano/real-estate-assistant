# Cursor IDE Rules for RealeAgent

## Project Context
You are working on RealeAgent, a 3-week prototype for AI-powered real estate transactions. Currently in Week 2, building React Native mobile app.

## Always Check First
1. `.cursor/project-board/command-center.md` - Current tasks and priorities
2. `.cursor/ai-instructions/cursor-context.md` - Development context and standards

## Current Focus
- **Directory**: `/mobile-app` - React Native + Expo development
- **Integration**: Connect with existing `/api-server` APIs
- **Standards**: TypeScript strict, functional components, React Native Paper UI

## Key Rules
- Reference existing API patterns in `/api-server/src/routes/`
- Use demo property ML81234567 for testing
- Maintain <300ms response time targets
- Follow mobile-first, touch-optimized design
- Update command-center.md when completing tasks

## Quick Commands
- `npm run dev:mobile` - Start Expo dev server
- `npm run dev:api` - Start backend if needed
- Check `demo-data/` for test data structure
