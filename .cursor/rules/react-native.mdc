# React Native Development Rules

## Component Structure
- Use arrow functions: const PropertyCard = ({ property }: Props) => {}
- Split components and styles: property-card/index.tsx and property-card/styles.ts
- Max 80 lines per component file
- Use React.memo() for static prop components

## State Management
- Use React Context for global state (Auth, Properties, Transactions)
- Minimize useState and useEffect usage
- Use React Query for API calls with caching

## TypeScript
- Interfaces over types
- No any - use unknown and type guards
- Explicit return types for functions

## Expo Specific
- Use expo-image for optimized image loading
- Use expo-secure-store for sensitive data
- Use expo-updates for OTA updates

## Performance
- Implement lazy loading with React.Suspense
- Use FlatList with getItemLayout for lists
- Profile with React DevTools regularly

## ARIA Integration
- Always include ARIAFloatingButton on screens
- Pass current context to ARIA (property, transaction, etc.)
