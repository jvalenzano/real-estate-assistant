# Property Page Update Summary

## Changes Made to Fix Image Rendering and Status Issues

### 1. **Fixed Component Imports** (src/app/properties/page.tsx)
- Changed from default import to named import for PropertyCard
- Fixed the import statement: `import { PropertyCard } from '@/components/property/PropertyCard'`

### 2. **Created Data Transformation Function** (src/app/properties/page.tsx)
- Added `transformPropertyForCard()` function to convert demo property data to the format expected by PropertyCard
- Maps property statuses correctly (Contingent → Pending, Pending → In Escrow)
- Extracts image URLs from the image objects

### 3. **Updated Mock Data Images** (src/lib/mock-data.ts)
- Replaced all Unsplash image URLs with higher quality versions
- Added proper query parameters for better image loading: `?q=80&w=2000&auto=format&fit=crop`
- Each property now has 4 working images for the carousel

### 4. **Created Badge Component** (src/components/ui/badge.tsx)
- Added the missing Shadcn UI Badge component
- Includes proper TypeScript types and variant support

### 5. **Property Card Features** (Already existed in src/components/property/PropertyCard.tsx)
- Image carousel with navigation arrows
- Property status badges with color coding
- Days on market indicator
- Error handling for failed image loads

## Status Badge Color Scheme
- **Active**: Green background
- **Pending**: Yellow background  
- **In Escrow**: Blue background
- **Sold**: Gray background

## To Test the Implementation

1. The development server should already be running on http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/properties
3. You should see:
   - Properties with working image carousels (click arrows to navigate)
   - Color-coded status badges in the top-left of each property
   - Days on market indicator in the top-right
   - Properly formatted prices and property details

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/properties/page.tsx` - Fixed imports and added data transformation
2. `src/lib/mock-data.ts` - Updated all image URLs for better quality
3. `src/components/ui/badge.tsx` - Created missing badge component

## No Additional Dependencies Required
- All necessary packages (class-variance-authority) were already installed
- Next.js configuration already supports Unsplash images

The property page should now display correctly with all images loading, carousel functionality working, and status badges showing with appropriate colors.
